# Ask me anything

Actually, I am not Jane Appleseed, and [@janeappleseed](https://github.com/janeappleseed) is not my primary GitHub handle, which you might have guessed. However, feel free to ask (or complain about) anything, especially if you were directed here. I will respond seriously if possible.

If you feel like having a private conversation, please briefly describe the topic, and leave your email address. I will scrub your email address once I see it. Please do NOT email janeappleseedgh AT gmail.com directly; I may not monitor the inbox.

Please be advised that I reserve the right to edit or delete anything on this AMA.
